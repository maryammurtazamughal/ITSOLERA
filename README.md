# ITSOLERA Internship Projects

Welcome to the ITSOLERA Internship repository! This directory contains multiple projects developed during the internship. As the Team Lead of the Computer Vision Team,
I am excited to present these projects, which demonstrate the latest advancements and innovative solutions in our field. Each project reflects our dedication to exploring and implementing cutting-edge technologies in computer vision and machine learning.

## OVERVIEW
### 1. CV Parsing Using OCR
#### Description:
This project automates the extraction of information from CVs (Curriculum Vitae) using Optical Character Recognition (OCR).
The system processes various file formats including PDF, DOCX, and DOC. It converts scanned images or PDFs into editable text
and applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to categorize and extract relevant information.

* Key Technologies
   OCR (Tesseract), spaCy, Python
* Usage
  Extracts structured data such as contact details, education, experience, and skills from CVs.

### 2. CV-Based Cursor Controller
#### Description:
This project implements a hand gesture recognition system to control the computer cursor based on recognized hand gestures.
Utilizing MediaPipe, opencv and Keras, the system can perform actions like scrolling and cursor movement.

* Key Technologies
   MediaPipe, Keras, OpenCV, pyautogui
* Usage
   Allows control of the computer cursor through hand gestures.

### 3. Face Recognition
#### Description:
This project focuses on face recognition and identification. Using the MTCNN & FaceNet model, the system recognizes and authenticates individuals based on facial features.
It is designed for integration with security applications for real-time identification.

* Key Technologies
   MTCNN, FaceNet, TensorFlow, Python
* Usage
   Real-time face recognition for security and authentication.

### 4. Smile Detection
#### Description:
This project focuses on detecting smiles in real-time using OenCV Haarcascade Classifier.
The system uses haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml & haarcascade_smile.xml to recognize facial expressions and detect smiles.

* Key Technologies
   OpenCV, Python
* Usage
   Real-time smile detection for various applications.

### 5. Traffic Signal Recognition
#### Description:
This project focuses on real-time traffic signal recognition using a ResNet model. The system is trained to detect and classify various traffic signals (e.g., stop, speed limit, pedestrian crossing) from video feeds or images. It's ideal for autonomous driving systems and smart transportation solutions.
* Key Technologies
   ResNet, OpenCV, TensorFlow, Python
* Usage
   Real-time traffic sign detection and classification for autonomous vehicles and traffic monitoring systems.


### 6. Realistic 3D Model generation from 2D images
#### Description:
This project aims to construct 3D representations of objects or scenes using MediaPipe. By capturing multiple 2D frames and analyzing depth and pose, the system creates a realistic 3D mesh of the subject â€” useful in AR/VR, medical imaging, and animation.

* Key Technologies
   Python, MiDaS, Tensorflow
* Usage
   3D image construction from 2D input for applications like augmented reality, 3D modeling, and facial animation.
