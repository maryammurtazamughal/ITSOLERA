# Traffic Signal Recognition

This project demonstrates a deep learning model trained to recognize various traffic signs from images using a convolutional neural network.
The goal is to assist intelligent transport systems and autonomous vehicles in accurately detecting road signs in real-time.

## Project Overview

Model: ResNet-based CNN
 * Dataset: German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
 * Task: Multi-class classification of traffic signs
 *  Output: Predicted traffic sign class given an image
